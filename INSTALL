Installation of the edif functions should be a matter of

	cd edif 
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Building the edif native functions requires that the source code for GNU APL 
be available.  The build process will try to find the source (using 
apl --show_src_dir) but if it fails, the location can be set manually
during configure

	./configure --apl-source-dir=<source dir>

If the configure step fails, it may be necessary to rebuild the configuration
script, which may be done with:

	cd edif
	./autoconf.sh

(Doing this requires that the autotools (autoconf, automake, and libtools) 
be installed.)

Of course, the edif functions are pointless without external editors. For 
edif, only vim and nano have been tested; for edif2, only emacs and gvim
(from the vim-X11 package) have been tested.
